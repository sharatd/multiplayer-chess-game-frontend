# multiplayer-chess-game-frontend

This game is a multiplayer chess game in which two players can play against each other in real time. When one player starts a new game session, a new game ID is created and the other player can join the session using the session URL. In this project, I used Javascript and HTML/CSS while utilizing the NodeJS runtime environment and React framework. In addition, I coded the front-end and back-end parts of this application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) method.
